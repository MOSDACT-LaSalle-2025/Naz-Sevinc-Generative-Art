## 🖋️ Description

**Embracing My Roots**  

...I embrace my roots — the branches that make me who I am. I hold them close, to plant them again in safe soil. I cling to them so I do not lose myself, to give them the love and care they need to live...

This work is my generative art meditation on immigration — on gathering your roots when you can take nothing else, on carrying your history, your networks, your past into the unknown. It is about the loneliness of that journey, and the solace of holding on to what still connects you to yourself. It is also about the pain of being uprooted from the motherland, yet knowing those roots remain alive.

Every root here is alive — its color, sway, length, and branching born of randomness. The colors speak of family, history, friendships, culture — different forms of belonging. Some roots slip away no matter how tightly you hold them. Immigration is like that: you cannot carry everything whole and living. The randomness is the truth — we cannot choose how the process unfolds. Still, I hold on to as much as I can, until I can lay them into new soil.
